# Wallbound (Unity 2D)

**Wallbound** is a work-in-progress 2D platformer developed in Unity.  
The project focuses on responsive player movement, vertical traversal mechanics, and dynamic camera behavior, with an emphasis on clean systems and iteration-friendly design.

Rather than being a finished product, Wallbound represents an actively evolving platformer project built on a solid technical foundation.

## 🛠️ Technical Focus

- Platformer movement and physics handling
- Climbing and traversal system design
- Animation state management
- State-driven camera logic
- Cinemachine integration for smooth camera transitions
- Tilemap and Rule Tile usage for scalable level design

## 🚧 Project Status

Wallbound is currently under active development.  
Core movement, traversal, animation, and camera systems are implemented, forming the technical backbone of the project.

New gameplay systems and content are being added incrementally.

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

- Enemy AI and environmental hazards
- Collectibles and checkpoint system
- Level progression and difficulty scaling
- Improved player feedback (visual and audio effects)
- Additional camera states and transitions
- Polished level design and environmental variety

## 📌 Development Notes

This project is being developed alongside a structured Unity learning process and is extended with personal technical and design decisions beyond the course material.

The repository reflects an iterative development approach rather than a finalized release.
